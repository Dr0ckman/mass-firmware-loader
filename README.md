# mass-firmware-loader
Small program put together with pasta and hotdog water. I use it to mass sideload stuff on android devices through USB.
Requires the last version of Python 3 and adding ADB to Path. 

Also, the program is in Spanish because my native language is Spanish and I use this thing at work. Feel free to translate it if you want. I might do it eventually if I have some free time :)
